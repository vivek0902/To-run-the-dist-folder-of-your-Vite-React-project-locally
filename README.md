To run the **`dist`** folder of your **Vite React** project locally, follow these steps:

---

### âœ… **1. Install `serve` (If Not Installed)**
Vite does not include a built-in way to serve the `dist/` folder locally. Use the `serve` package:

```sh
npm install -g serve
```

---

### âœ… **2. Build the Project**
Ensure your project is built before running:

```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate a `dist/` folder.

---

### âœ… **3. Serve the `dist/` Folder**
Run the following command inside your project directory:

```sh
serve -s dist
```

---

### âœ… **4. Open in Browser**
Once the server starts, you should see output like:

```
Serving!
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

Go to **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to view your deployed **`dist/`** build locally.

---

### ðŸš€ **Alternative: Using Python HTTP Server**
If you donâ€™t want to install `serve`, you can use Python:

```sh
cd dist
python -m http.server 3000
```
Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.
